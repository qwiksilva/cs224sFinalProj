    0.498043   -1 part of 'z' or part of vowel?
    0.612666   -1 not tcl but some sort of trans-like element-part of false start?
    1.103903   -1 fricated glottal stop?
    1.505720   -1 might have to re-align "to" here
    2.069797   -1 vcl? no audible or visual frication
    3.046901   -1 may want to erase hh and extend h# to here
