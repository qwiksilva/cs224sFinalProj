README for dev-test/
part of ICSI Switchboard Transcription Project 1996 final release
Dan Ellis <dpwe@icsi.berkeley.edu> 1996oct31

This package contains the hand-transcribed phonetic label files for
files from the Switchboard speech corpus designated the "dev-test"
set.  They are a subset of the original dev-test set, since very short
files, or files containing exclusively non-word sounds, were excluded.

There are 451 files containing a total of 16433 phoneme labels, and 
corresponding to 22.98 minutes of speech.

The files in this package are:

./FILES			A list of the 451 file identifiers included
			(e.g. 2151-A-0002), each on a separate line

./phn/			Directory of the phonetic transcription files
			(e.g. 2151-A-0002.phn).  These are in "xlabel" 
			format, as are the remaining files.

./wrd/			Word transcription files (e.g. 2151-A-0002.wrd), 
			Some corrections to the original transcriptions 
			have been made.

./com/			Comment label files (2151-A-0002.com) added by 
			the transcribers to flag unusual events or 
			circumstances. 

./lib/stp-status	Record of the two transcribers who worked on each file
			(this was the file used to track each transcription, 
			but the format is self-explanatory).

./lib/PHNFRQ		Formatted frequency counts of phonemes, diacritics
			and diphones.

./lib/WRDFRQ		Formatted frequency counts of words and wordpairs.
