For detailed system description see the primary system description for cu-htk1.

Systems with contrasts are:

cu-htk1 : Primary system. Uses gender-independent MMIE (maximum mutual information 
          estimation) trained triphones and quinphones and gender-dependent soft-tied
          MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) trained triphones and quinphones.
          All model sets use side-based MLLR (maximum likelihood linear regression) 
          and full-variance transform adaptation, pronunciation probabilities and 
          an interpolated word 4-gram/category trigram language model to produce 
          confusion networks and corresponding minimum expected word error rate 
          hypotheses. The primary system combines the confusion networks for each of
          the 4 model sets via a dynamic programming technique to produce the final 
          combined output.

cu-htk2 : MMIE triphone/quinphone contrast. Uses 2-way system combination (rather 
          than 4-way) using the adapted MMIE triphone and quinphone outputs only.

cu-htk3 : MLE triphone/quinphone contrast. Uses 2-way system combination (rather 
          than 4-way) using the adapted MLE triphone and quinphone outputs only.

cu-htk4 : MMIE quinphone only contrast. Uses the minimum expected word error rate 
          output from the adapted quinphone models alone.
