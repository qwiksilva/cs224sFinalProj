       NIST ROVER/1999 PRIMARY SYSTEM
       HUB-4 CORE TEST
 

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The ROVER [fiscus] system was applied to the five systems submitted
for the 2000 English Hub-5 evaluation.  The systems used were:

	att1-debugged
	bbn1-debugged
	cu-htk1
	msstate1
	sri1

The ASR system outputs of the five systems were pre-processed using
the Global Mapping file from the evaluation in order to normalize the
transcripts.  Voting was done without regard to confidence scores since
only three of the five participants supplied confidence scores.
