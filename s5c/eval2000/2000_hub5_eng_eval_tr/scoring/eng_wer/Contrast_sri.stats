|  These significance tests are all two-tailed tests with the null hypothesis  |
|  that there is no performance difference between the two systems.            |
|                                                                              |
|  The first column indicates if the test finds a significant difference       |
|  at the level of p=0.05.  It consists of '~' if no difference is             |
|  found at this significance level.  If a difference at this level is         |
|  found, this column indicates the system with the higher value on the        |
|  performance statistic utilized by the particular test.                      |
|                                                                              |
|  The second column specifies the minimum value of p for which the test       |
|  finds a significant difference at the level of p.                           |
|                                                                              |
|  The third column indicates if the test finds a significant difference       |
|  at the level of p=0.001 ("***"), at the level of p=0.01, but not            |
|  p=0.001 ("**"), or at the level of p=0.05, but not p=0.01 ("*").            |
|                                                                              |
|  A test finds significance at level p if, assuming the null hypothesis,      |
|  the probability of the test statistic having a value at least as            |
|  extreme as that actually found, is no more than p.                          |
