14.96 16.93 A: [noise] [noise]
23.01 29.45 A: [noise] um well we have a budget [noise] um we get paid every two weeks and i have certain bills at certain times
29.45 32.13 A: you know i either first of or the middle of the month [noise]
32.13 41.69 A: [noise] and i pay the bills according to that and then what i- k- and then i budget like our savings i budget that out [noise] and daycare i budget that out [noise] because <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm a college student
41.69 50.92 A: [noise] and so i have to be real careful how we handle the money [noise] but um i- we yes we live from paycheck to paycheck too

67.92 69.93 A: um-hum [noise]
79.00 80.51 A: uh-huh
86.23 98.29 A: [noise] well we budget our- our purchases like if <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're gonna buy a refrigerator for example [noise] and we had to take a loan for that [noise] then i- i- d- deciding how quick i wanted to pay it off or what i could afford <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['d=>would]">i'd double the payment
98.29 101.07 A: [noise] and maybe pay it off in a year or six months
101.07 106.81 A: [noise] and so i would figure out and <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's the only way <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ve=>have]">we've been able to buy big items
106.81 112.51 A: [noise] it seems like you know u- ((if)) we need furniture then you know a bedroom suite then we need to budget it [noise]
112.51 118.43 A: [noise] and then you know you g- meet the most payment we can meet and yet still do okay 
121.58 123.20 A: uh everything
123.20 126.02 A: um-hum [noise] one step at a time
132.81 134.05 A: um-hum

148.93 150.15 A: um-hum
150.15 153.93 A: [noise]
153.93 159.22 A: overa- i write it out every time [noise] and i might sometimes even do it a paycheck ahead
159.22 165.52 A: just to figure out next time in the next two weeks what <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ll=>will]">i'll have left over and then wh- how i can use that money
165.52 167.79 A: [noise] according to what we need
167.79 171.94 A: [noise] <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm not going to tell you <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're not maxed out because being in college i am
171.94 179.55 A: i mean you know <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're living a- [laughter] [noise] at a rate tha- which is barely getting by [noise] until i graduate and then <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ll=>will]">we'll be able to double our income
184.87 186.93 A: <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm looking forward to it [laughter]
186.93 198.20 A: [noise] but uh even in that way we figured if we just turn all my paychecks over [noise] and budget it into the bills <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ll=>will]">we'll have every bill including our car and truck paid off [noise] in like four months
198.20 202.21 A: [noise] i- you know so <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's kind of what <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're looking at
202.21 211.16 A: [noise] now <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's not including student loans [laughter] but those loans are so much cheaper that budget-wise <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're smart to keep those till last
213.65 216.65 A: they certainly are seven or eight percent
216.65 219.81 A: yeah [noise] well <contraction e_form="[could=>could][n't=>not]">couldn't make it without those
219.81 227.00 A: [noise] but- but even so i kind of budget like uh what <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ll=>will]">i'll be able to p- afford even when i graduate how much those loans are gonna add up to be [noise] 
227.00 230.60 A: you know so that i know exactly what <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ll=>will]">i'll be p- owing

254.96 258.95 A: [noise] and the only way we could afford to get those lots of things was to do it this way
258.95 264.87 A: okay for four months <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're gonna buy a refrigerator so for four months [noise] <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're gonna channel all the money into that
