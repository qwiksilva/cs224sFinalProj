0.00 9.37 A: well i used to be a teacher and i think there are many things wrong with the public school system and <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's why i got out of teaching
13.51 22.84 A: well um i think the main problem is <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's just not enough discipline and the classes are too big
22.84 25.12 A: because um
28.01 31.75 A: kids just get away with too much and <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's not [noise]
31.75 35.83 A: really that much that a teacher can do because
35.83 46.00 A: um the administration is worried about the big problems about um you know kids bringing guns to school
46.00 50.73 A: and they <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have time to worry about the p- the problems of 
50.73 55.66 A: of management that they used to be able to worry about
181.14 192.82 A: well i think n- the problem with that the problem i had because when i went into teaching i decided that i was just gonna be you know the perfect creative teacher and 
192.82 198.10 A: um my kids were gonna just think that learning was fun and
198.10 200.72 A: i was teaching eighth grade
202.29 204.12 A: yes
205.13 206.69 A: [laughter]
206.69 209.35 A: well this was in South Carolina
210.35 213.77 A: but anyway the problem that i had
213.77 222.06 A: was um my students <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't really know how to respond to that and
222.06 224.16 A: they basically
224.16 229.79 A: <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't they <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't appreciate everything i was trying to do for them because i would have [noise]
229.79 240.07 A: learning games all the time and i tried to do just fun things and make it interesting and do creative thinking
240.07 247.78 A: just all kinds of things and they just took advantage of me and they walked all over me and i was never
247.78 255.53 A: able to establish any kind of discipline because i started out being too nice
262.80 275.37 A: well see <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's the thing is i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't think that they do respect teachers and <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm saying that that that well just that ((the)) administration in my school <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't give me any support and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like after
275.37 279.64 A: you know ((that)) the students were already taking advantage of me
279.64 285.89 A: um they just told me to just crack down and then they <contraction e_form="[would=>would][n't=>not]">wouldn't support me in that
285.89 295.32 A: and they just told that the only way that these students would respond would be if i had a completely structured environment and i was miserable
295.32 297.41 A: doing that
2.64 3.58 B: um-hum
9.30 13.69 B: well yo- uh ((wonder)) ((what)) were the problems that you found in uh public school systems
45.19 46.51 B: yeah
54.53 60.93 B: we- we- i- i think the problem is that uh i- if you start concerning yourself more with discipline [noise] i think um
60.93 73.51 B: i think teachers' main goal should be more instead of worrying about discipline is getting t- th- students or you know kids interested in learning because [noise] as i can recall where i went to go go- to school um 
73.51 88.27 B: most of the teachers were just basically bent on either trying to discipline you and then force you to go through this material and show no really interest i mean in to making it interesting or fun fun and and school were two oxymoron type of word 
88.27 94.03 B: [noise] and i think that was basically the problem because they were t- more interes- they built up this type of um
94.03 106.49 B: [noise] i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know uh this might not be in your case but at least where i went to school uh a superiority complex where [noise] they had to be always more intelligent than their students and it was impossible for students [noise] they felt more intimidated 
106.49 111.88 B: when uh people would ask you know questions that they <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't understand themselves so then rather than [noise]
111.88 123.68 B: doing this they would either you know ridicule the student or tell them to shut up or you know this is not what <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're covering <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're doing this and so certain kids who would be interested in exploring different er avenues where just basically shunted because
123.68 133.37 B: [noise] you know there- you know it- they were all more concerned that everybody follows along a certain path [noise] although i agree [noise] that disciplining is uh important um
133.37 139.07 B: -[a]nd especially since [noise] there are in- uh in different areas where [noise] kids are already grown to
139.07 148.93 B: uh a point of rebellion where guns as you mentioned [noise] but uh in general uh in certain areas i think if i- if they started earlier maybe not in just [noise]
148.93 155.68 B: the high school level but i mean elementary school maybe you have to worry about [noise] switchblades instead of guns [noise] um
155.68 163.61 B: [noise] that the students would you know if the teachers got kids interested more into learning rather than [noise] bickering [noise] <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['d=>would]">you'd uh elimanate these
163.61 165.97 B: [noise] pseudo-rebel roles that are created
165.97 180.42 B: [noise] because you know if the teacher says <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't do this and then kids do it and especially that age [noise] they want to be a rebel so <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're different they prove themselves by [noise] you know uh um going against the establishment type of thing [noise] uh what do you think
190.13 191.49 B: uh-huh
196.92 198.61 B: [noise] what grade were you teaching
199.81 200.83 B: oh really
200.83 202.78 B: w- guns at that level too
202.78 207.25 B: [laughter] okay w- this is in North Carolina [noise] 
208.45 209.64 B: okay
219.26 220.57 B: um-hum
234.07 235.51 B: uh-huh
254.46 264.42 B: really do you think the problem might have originated [noise] at an earlier stage [noise] that maybe kids <contraction e_form="[were=>were][n't=>not]">weren't really taught much to respect [noise] you know teachers and also try to get interested
278.78 280.10 B: um-hum
