356.76 359.67 A: {laugh} I know [[in the laugh]]  

358.63 364.05 B: but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm really glad <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're in the administrative side now because <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's where the money is at and you learn a lot more you know

375.45 377.53 B: dealing with the average person with their  

378.11 387.51 B: to stress over what <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>were]">they're getting on their trays I mean a lot of times you know even after I have a thing on ketogenic diet I mean to send to you too and that but even after these years <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's pretty much what we were still doing.  

384.39 385.32 A: oh yes  

388.34 396.37 B: and <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's why I decided to cash in my chips when I had &Colleen because I thought oh this is not going to change I can come back in ten years <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['ll=>will]">it'll be the same thing {laugh}

405.80 406.24 B: {lipsmack} {inhale}  

406.89 414.36 B: well <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's truly the sandwich generation though because like each day she learns something new and now my mom is pretty much so limited and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's so hard to see this but  

409.48 409.71 A: (( ))
