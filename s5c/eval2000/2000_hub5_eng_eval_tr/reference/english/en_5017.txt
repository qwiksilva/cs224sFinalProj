138.14 138.60 B: %mm   

138.66 141.42 A: and so <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're not happy about that so    

141.14 141.61 B: mhm   

142.72 144.97 A: %um {breath} but anyway, %uh    

145.25 147.94 A: %uh you know, <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's they <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have any choice in it

151.41 151.79 B: {breath}   

151.93 153.70 A: they had a cake for me yesterday    

153.82 154.32 B: mhm   

154.27 157.43 A: yeah I thought that was nice. they all signed the card and the whole thing   

157.48 158.03 B: mhm {breath} 

157.94 162.04 A: and %um {breath} so I got %ah I got one more week    

162.25 162.59 B: mhm   

162.44 164.51 A: and {breath} <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's it, so    

165.43 169.47 A: {lipsmack} {breath} <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm really, %uh, kind of excited about    

170.36 173.37 A: you know, about finishing u-, finishing up  and going down there   

173.37 173.97 B: mhm    

174.23 176.15 A: and I want to %um    

176.70 178.08 B: I think you should move down there   

178.26 179.91 A: {inhale} %um {exhale}   

179.81 183.73 B: I was thinking about it, if <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying this woman money, plus <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying your rent    

184.51 184.99 A: yeah   

184.75 187.84 B: y-, it would be worth it to get an apartment down there <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying the same {breath}  

188.13 192.85 A: yeah I d- that would be, that would be much easier, %um  

193.47 193.90 B: {breath}   

193.87 200.77 A: the %um, the the only problem is that the the rents there are are really really high {breath} and %um   

200.52 205.64 B: did you look though? I mean, I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't think <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't, I know <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're higher <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're probably a little bit    

205.75 210.83 B: {breath} higher than what <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying now, but if <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying that woman money to s- stay there and <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're paying    

211.50 215.59 B: you know your rent, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm sure you could find an apartment for the same amount of money   

215.45 220.62 A: {breath} yeah, I want to be right in the town %uh, right in the city where <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm working. (( ))   

220.31 220.85 B: why?   

221.06 222.95 A: well, %uh we- well <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's nice. I mean it   

222.91 223.25 B: oh   

223.04 226.51 A: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a good place, but {breath} just to cut down on the on the commuting     

226.61 227.08 B: uh-huh   

227.08 231.94 A: because if I am, and <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm in the right place, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd only be like two or three miles from the job. <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's --   

231.78 232.04 B: %mm 

231.95 234.19 A: -- what I would like. ideally <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's what I would like    

234.23 234.66 B: mhm   

234.99 238.36 A: %um, I, w-, when I, when I start, <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>was]">there's   

237.74 238.82 B: {breath}   

238.53 245.51 A: <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>was]">there's somebody down there <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>was]">that's dealing, that that has, <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's into real estate, and <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going to ask, but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've been reading the paper, and %um    

246.91 250.54 A: the %um, %eh you know, they they want like close to a thousand dollars    

250.76 251.24 B: mhm   

251.18 257.31 A: so %uh {breath} everything I noticed is %uh, you know, you go to the grocery store, you go to the gas station    

257.59 259.21 A: you know, is a lot higher    

259.35 259.71 B: mhm   

259.65 265.38 A: and %um, %uh, at least %um, what I was doing like for the summer, is that I was coming up and {breath}   

265.73 273.76 A: never buying gas down there but getting it here or %um, if I went to &Long &Island, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd get it there where <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's cheaper {breath} and %um  

274.00 275.39 A: {lipsmack} and then I would %um     

275.60 281.98 A: you know, load up on my groceries, and anything I was going to have, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd bring down there so <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd kind of avoid it that way    

282.17 282.75 B: mhm {breath} 

282.78 287.92 A: but %um, you know I I, that would be a whole lot easier but then     

289.22 292.77 A: I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know whenever I would %eh get to see you and &Mike    

293.60 297.31 A: %um, I <contraction e_form="[would=>would][n't=>not]">wouldn't, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd be a lot closer to you  --

296.90 297.42 B: right    

297.43 299.67 A: -- and that th-  and that part <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['d=>would]">I'd like but    

300.21 304.73 A: %uh like for any, you know, any occasions, anything, %um    

305.27 307.48 A: %uh you know I, %eh %uh I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know    

308.86 309.27 A: %uh   

310.06 312.15 A: y- y- I I just get the feeling that    

312.76 315.31 A: %uh that you would probably come up to this area    

315.93 320.83 A: but not where I am, as you know, as %uh often {lipsmack} so I    

321.33 322.67 B: %mm I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know about that     

323.70 326.83 B: I mean, yeah, I guess you know, we have more friends and stuff there {breath} 

326.89 327.79 A: yeah, and you    

327.76 327.97 B: but   

328.50 328.78 A: (( ))   

328.68 329.50 B: you know {breath}   

330.30 332.62 A: so I {breath} and then of course when    

332.75 337.15 A: &Jill comes home, like and <contraction e_form="[she=>she]['ll=>will]">she'll be %uh coming home at Thanksgiving    

337.22 337.59 B: mhm   

337.60 340.59 A: and <contraction e_form="[everybody=>everybody]['s=>is]">everybody's going to be congregating up here    

340.76 341.06 B: mhm   

341.23 343.05 A: so y- y- you know <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's %um    

344.65 348.66 A: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a tough decision but then %uh as I was saying on the on the other hand    

349.62 350.30 A: as soon as I    

350.02 353.76 B: <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's kind of a ri-, a l- a little bit ridiculous though to stay in    

354.25 359.32 B: you know one place for an o- you know, for an occasion, for Thanksgiving, that comes around once a year   

359.71 360.19 A: %mm  

360.25 362.48 B: you know, I mean, I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know   

362.48 366.83 A: yeah {breath} I yeah, I know it so I <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've I %uh    

367.17 370.88 A: I <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm stuck here at least, through %uh through August    

371.07 371.36 B: mhm   

371.08 375.00 A: because of, because of the lease, but {breath} even, even at that, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm not    

375.63 380.17 A: <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm stuck here but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm tied in but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm not. if I wanted to leave I could do that,    

380.29 380.65 B: mhm 

380.78 383.80 A: %um, I could just wait until somebody comes in and    

383.83 384.19 B: right    

383.89 386.36 A: and wants the place, and so I <contraction e_form="[would=>would][n't=>not]">wouldn't be pressed to go    

386.46 386.85 B: right   

387.01 391.36 A: and then %uh the other option that I was thinking of was after the %um     

392.36 394.83 A: %uh after the car is paid off    

395.53 396.01 A: to go    

397.02 402.62 A: %uh move my stuff into &Beakman, and use that as a primary residence but yet    

403.01 407.18 A: but then like rent a room, down there in the town <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm working in    

407.56 412.79 A: so at least what <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ll=>will]">I'll be paying is %um a room which which should be a lot cheaper and   

413.34 417.87 A: and %um I would be, I I would be just adding to the time    

418.23 418.58 B: mhm
