100.11 103.88 B: and I looked it up to see if that was a job I felt like doing, and %um  

104.66 107.92 B: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['ll=>will]">it'll be the biggest job <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've ever done on a car, but I think <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ll=>will]">I'll go ahead and give it a try  

108.47 108.88 A: mhm  

109.20 109.90 B: and %um  

110.83 117.71 B: but the bottom line is, you may remember my mentioning some while back that I was preaching in &Alaska, [metallic sound] %uh, back in January  

117.89 118.30 A: right  

119.09 122.47 B: and %ah, making a long story short, through the course of that service,   

122.94 128.95 B: I began to feel like I needed to %ah, be engaged in outrage among some of the &Arabic people  

129.70 130.08 A: mhm  

129.78 131.27 B: here in %ah the &Detroit area.  

132.18 135.99 B: and <contraction e_form="[have=>have][n't=>not]">haven't know how to start, and have been praying for contacts with &Arabic people  

137.55 139.23 B: well, through looking for this car, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've got it  

139.79 140.56 A: %ah  

141.04 146.86 B: what had ended up happening is %um, I went over to get the ((vin)) number sunday night so I could get my insurance  

147.26 147.47 B: by  

147.35 147.67 A: mhm  

147.52 150.18 B: phone, you know on on Monday morning, and then go over and get   

149.96 150.24 A: right  

150.19 151.22 B: the car and bring it home  

152.62 156.42 B: and %ah, while we were talking, I said what country are you from, and he said &Lebanon  

157.19 159.76 B: and %um, so I said to him   

160.79 164.93 B: I said %ah, people like you are what make &America great, the immigrant  

165.74 166.07 A: mhm  

166.29 166.94 B: and know  

167.45 168.78 A: an interesting observation  

168.84 172.69 B: he said, he said, that in eighteen years of living here, no one had ever said that to him.   

172.94 173.26 A: %ha %ha  

173.69 176.56 B: that all <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['d=>had]">he'd heard was, you guys come over here, you take all our money,   

177.75 181.88 B: he says yeah, he says we take money he says, we take them from the jobs where <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're working.  

182.25 183.96 B: he says just like anyone else who works  

184.30 184.71 A: mhm  

185.32 188.43 B: so, <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>has]">there's been a lot of hostility in &Detroit toward the &Arabic peop-  

189.47 196.59 B: and %um oh. so in any case, through that remark, what happened is, when I went over there on Monday,  

197.89 199.97 B: he said he was very embarrassed he <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't have the title  

200.91 207.46 B: and what has happened is, <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['s=>has]">he's been running a collision shop so about a month ago, he had gone over to an auction  to buy a car for his wife,   

208.19 209.57 B: and he had bought this &Volvo  

210.75 215.21 B: and then %ah, it had a mechanical problem, and he <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't even want to try to mess with it   

215.54 219.31 B: it, one mechanic said it was the head gasket, one said it is the thermostat  

219.81 220.21 A: mhm  

220.35 224.41 B: and he said if <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just the thermostat, then <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm getting a car that needs almost no work  

224.79 229.00 B: for twenty five hundred. but the bottom line is, <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['s=>is]">he's  selling it to me basically for what <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['s=>has]">he's got in it.   

229.41 229.97 A: uh-huh  

230.12 232.39 B: and %ah, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just something he <contraction e_form="[does=>does][n't=>not]">doesn't want to work on the car.   

232.58 232.92 A: right   

233.18 233.85 B: and %ah,   

235.17 239.35 B: %ah, so so <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>was]">that's what happened, but meanwhile the title is tied up in &Lansing 

239.91 240.46 A: oh  

240.72 242.09 B: because <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>was]">it's a theft recovery  

242.55 242.96 A: mhm  

243.12 247.25 B: so %um, the insurance company had auctioned it, you know, and <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['s=>has]">he's been driving it for a month  

247.96 252.00 B: but %um, you know to register it is one thing, but to have the title in your hand is another  

253.14 257.56 B: so %um, he said that it it could be as much as two more weeks before he gets it   

258.42 258.84 A: mhm  

259.16 260.88 B: or it could arrive in the mail today.   

261.49 261.74 A: yeah  

262.61 267.43 B: but meanwhile, %ah he was so embarrassed about that whole thing he had me in, I had coffee with him   

267.72 274.74 B: %um, I asked him where to buy pine nuts, <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['d=>had]">we'd been to a few of the &Arabic restaurants here in town, and &<contraction e_form="[Debbie=>Debbie]['s=>has]">Debbie's taken a liking to pine nut  

275.72 278.08 B: so his wife ended up giving us a big bag of pine nut  

278.71 279.23 A: oh  

279.93 280.53 B: and %um  

281.95 283.53 B: you know plus you know, we know where to get them now  

283.99 284.30 A: yes  

284.34 287.59 B: plus they want to get together and %um all have dinner together  

287.73 288.02 A: yeah  

288.40 292.75 B: and %um, he seems to be a &Muslim, though he was talking more like a &Hindu  

293.42 293.68 A: %hm  

293.84 295.62 B: he said all roads lead to the same god  

296.07 296.85 A: yeah {laugh}  

296.57 297.56 B: %uh (( ))   

297.47 297.78 A: mhm  

297.63 298.69 B: classic &Hinduism  

299.24 299.45 A: yeah  

300.71 301.36 B: so in any case,  

300.86 301.01 A: (( ))  

301.42 304.99 B: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's %ah turned out to be not just one, but two answers to prayer,    

305.47 305.81 A: %hm  

305.96 307.73 B: you know, with a bit of a delay thrown in but  

307.62 308.02 A: right  

308.17 310.55 B: %ah, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm not real anxious about that   

312.46 316.90 B: frankly by the time I get the car, probably the heat wave will break and it <contraction e_form="[wo=>will][n't=>not]">won't be so bad working on it  

315.50 317.11 A: {laugh} yeah  

317.77 320.78 A: and %ah, well now, will you check out the thermostat first? 

321.08 321.42 B: oh yeah  

321.86 327.41 A: mhm and %ah so ((preferably)) that will be all it, all it needs  

327.95 330.16 B: well if it does need a head gasket, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's %um   

332.05 337.81 B: I I looked it up in &Volvo and it looks like &<contraction e_form="[Volvo=>Volvo]['s=>is]">Volvo's probably one of the easiest cars there is to change a head gasket on  

337.10 339.98 A: alright, did I bring my torsion wrench up to you?  

340.31 340.67 B: yeah  

341.01 341.46 A: okay  

341.70 344.64 B: yeah, but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going to have to get %ah, get one <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's better calibrated   

345.43 345.83 A: oh  

345.98 347.65 B: because <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm (( )) %um  

349.71 351.99 B: it <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just something where %um  

352.62 355.73 B: they, they make a kind where you set a dial and it clicks and so on  

356.21 356.69 A: oh {breath}  

356.38 359.09 B: <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going to have to do that because <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've got to have real precision if I    

357.50 357.91 A: mhm [distorted]  

358.75 360.52 A: maybe you can trade off for it then  

361.70 362.12 B: well  

361.86 362.37 A: trade %ah   

363.32 366.27 A: trade the one I brought up %ah into the dial one   

367.23 368.52 B: I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know how, you know I mean   

369.02 370.68 A: yeah, and %ah   

370.26 371.90 B: <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've never heard of trading tools, but  

372.16 372.43 A: yeah  

372.74 375.64 B: well in, you know, unless it was with a, a person, but  

376.00 376.41 A: mhm  

377.32 377.75 B: but %um  

377.84 378.39 A: {cough}  

379.41 379.80 A: so  

379.47 383.29 B: yeah, the other one is fine for things like setting the wheel bearings and that kind of thing.  

383.36 383.81 A: mhm  

384.00 387.71 B: but %um, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going to have to have real precision on %um  

388.27 388.87 B: on -ed  

388.28 388.61 A: right  

389.48 389.94 A: {clearing throat}  

389.92 394.39 B: but the way I look at it is, if <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm buying oh four to five thousand dollar car for   

394.66 398.92 B: twenty five hundred and I have to go out and spend forty dollars on a wrench, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm not really going to worry about it
