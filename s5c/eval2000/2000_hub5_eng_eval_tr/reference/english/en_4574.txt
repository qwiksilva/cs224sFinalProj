348.39 354.60 A: well, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've just been working, but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm planning my next vacation which is, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going in September to &Japan.  

354.86 355.59 B: wow  

355.56 356.61 A: {lipsmack} how about that?  

355.82 356.97 B: oh, a rich girl  

357.39 360.17 A: well, no actually, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going into debt to do it, but  

360.89 366.06 A: I decided, you know, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've been telling my students, because &Rachel lived here two years ago, and  

366.06 368.59 A: <contraction e_form="[she=>she]['s=>was]">she's the one that really said come and stay with me   

369.04 372.33 A: and then this other girl that I had as as a student ten years ago,   

372.72 378.61 A: still keeps in touch, and she called me and said when are you coming, and I thought if I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't go <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're going to stop asking me.  

379.07 385.17 A: and that way, you know and this way at least it, you know, I can go and have a place to stay part of the time anyway.     

385.61 388.56 A: but <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going on a courier flight too, you know, where,   

388.30 388.70 B: oh.  

389.06 392.99 A: %um, you carry somebody else's luggage, or something else for somebody  

392.03 393.80 B: {laugh} drugs  

393.73 394.42 A: well maybe  

393.96 398.96 B: <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't carry anything illegal, and if <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're going to, <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't discuss it now on the taped conversation.  

398.46 405.41 A: {laugh} really. well, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's really like being a spy, you should see these instructions I have, you know it say's like you have to get to the airport and --  

405.72 411.03 A: look for a guy in a blue jacket with a certain kind of s-, insignia on it and he will give you   

411.30 417.90 A: papers and take you to the luggage place and check you in and then the luggage will go and then you have one carry on piece,  

418.24 419.55 A: that you get to take, and then 

420.41 423.21 A: and then when you get to &Japan, you have to   

423.66 428.50 A: deliver the papers to a guy <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's in a certain location in the immigration area, and then   

428.78 430.22 A: he will take the luggage   

429.30 431.02 B: what kind of things are you carrying?  

431.64 438.05 A: I think <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're carrying, probably <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm carrying, boxes of stuff, or I might be carrying suitcases, I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know  

437.56 439.35 B: well I mean well what kind of things will be in them?  

440.08 444.50 A: well I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know, maybe documents or industrial stuff, I have no idea.  

445.07 451.39 A: but <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's all, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's, I mean, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's all legal, they guarantee <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's legal, and <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's a guy there that gives you the papers and takes the papers, so <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's not like   

451.62 454.21 A: {breath} you go through and the customs people say   

454.80 457.70 A: well, and the, and the papers say <contraction e_form="[what=>what]['s=>is]">what's in the stuff, you know   

458.03 463.50 A: but <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's a guy there that, to explain it so, supposedly <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's got to be legal stuff.    

463.79 467.85 A: and then when you come back you call, you call a man named &Mister &Noriko, and you  

467.88 470.97 A: tell him that <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're back in town, and <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['ll=>will]">he'll tell you where to meet him and then,   

471.27 478.22 A: you go to the airport and you meet a guy who may or may not give you things to bring back, because <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's %um   

479.02 484.16 A: <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's not sure, but he gives you back your tickets. see when you get to &Japan, they take your return ticket     

484.67 491.78 A: and you <contraction e_form="[can't=>cannot]">can't have it back until you come back {laugh} and so %um, then you get back, then <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's a guy at this end that meets you,  

490.50 491.23 B: {cough}   

492.08 493.22 A: and then as soon as he [background sound]  

492.58 494.42 B: {cough} this is very bizarre   

494.08 501.55 A: takes you, I know {laugh}, but &Buffy, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like a third of the cost of the round trip ticket to &Japan, in fact,  

501.93 506.64 A: it it was four hundred dollars round trip, right, to &Japan, so and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like  

506.27 507.47 B: four hundred dollars?  

507.38 507.81 A: yeah  

507.93 510.15 B: jesus, it must be about seventeen hundred from here  

510.35 513.78 A: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's twelve hundred from here. but <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's, <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm paying four  

513.63 515.14 B: oh. I was going to say  

514.55 516.37 A: <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm paying four hundred. yeah   

516.47 517.36 B: oh, <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's very cheap  

517.45 520.32 A: yeah, but %um, but the it <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's   

519.77 521.36 B: and then if you have a place to stay,   

521.50 522.45 A: right, and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's [distortion]  

521.93 525.84 B: now of course I understand it costs about eight hundred dollars a day to just walk around, but  

525.45 531.10 A: well, [distortion] and <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm going to get a train pass like you know they have in &Europe, but they have one in &Japan because  

531.44 534.67 A: flying is real expensive, and I want to go all these places, and  

534.74 539.52 A: though everybody says well you should fly there because you <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have very much time, but one flight in ja-  

538.75 541.51 B: so <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're going to get on one of those trains where they shove you in [channel noise]  

540.96 542.36 A: right, a bullet train   

541.78 544.92 B: they push you in behind and, behind and pack you in   

545.38 552.50 A: one, one, flight in &Japan, like I wanted to go &Hokkaido, <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's where &Sapporo is, you know in the very north, north part   

553.04 558.08 A: and a round trip flight from &Tokyo costs more than my round trip flight to &Japan
