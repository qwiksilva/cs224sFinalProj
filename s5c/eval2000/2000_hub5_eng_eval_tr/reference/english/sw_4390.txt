63.26 70.93 B: <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's uh i think you you know in a society you have to draw a line somewhere and say hey if you cross this line <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's it
82.01 84.30 B: exactly exactly
86.62 91.83 B: sure sure it costs every one of us to uh [noise] to support that person

123.48 130.15 B: that it ought to be is uh you ought to know exactly <contraction e_form="[what=>what]['s=>is]">what's going to happen and there ought to be a time frame for it to happen
130.15 144.22 B: well in other words uh you put somebody on on death row and and you can go on for ten or fifteen years appealing everything you know there ou- there ought to be you know <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm not saying it ought to be like you know two weeks and then <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're gone [noise] but uh
144.22 150.10 B: there ought to be some sort of uh vehicle to uh make it uh expeditious
153.93 160.79 B: yeah exactly exactly [laughter] fair and speedy all the way down the line i guess [laughter]
160.79 165.62 B: [noise] <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's uh you know <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a tough thing to decide but uh

193.45 201.53 B: you know aggravated rape i uh with di- i would think would have to uh <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['d=>would]">you'd have to consider that as in the in the death penalty range
201.53 204.72 B: yes exactly exactly
204.72 208.51 B: i mean <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's be almost uh one uh one person's word against another
