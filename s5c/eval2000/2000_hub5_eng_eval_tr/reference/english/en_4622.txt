120.79 121.87 B: kid of weird, but  

123.01 124.77 B: though I might get on to the net that way   

127.50 128.97 B: and %um  

128.32 129.29 A: [sound of twisting phone cord]  

129.17 132.00 B: and <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ll=>will]">I'll let you know if if that address becomes available.   

132.28 132.81 A: okay  

133.37 141.03 B: <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's also supposedly, you know, a magazine listing all of the internet service providers here and  

142.15 144.67 B: &Denver, which I need to still look over  

145.80 147.35 A: %hm. {breath}  

147.59 147.86 B: (( ))  

148.23 150.42 A: %um, what do those %um, cost?  

152.34 155.12 B: %uh, generally %ah runs about   

157.81 160.54 B: %ah, you know <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['ve=>have]">I've heard of things as low as twenty dollars a month   

161.90 163.14 B: actually <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's this one place  

163.32 164.52 B: that is, bulletin board  

165.05 167.99 B: which allows %ah, <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're   

168.96 171.72 B: I guess trying to attract new people so <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like twenty five dollars  

171.50 171.66 A: {breath}  

171.78 172.79 B: for the first year   

173.73 179.72 B: but in general I think, the theory is %um, access providers generally charge about twenty dollars a month  

179.15 181.41 A: [distortion] I see  

180.91 185.62 B: and the price can go up from there depending on how much  

186.39 188.07 B: volume you expect to be using   

190.08 193.86 B: last year, it was like seventy five dollars for a slip account, which is like this   

194.44 198.73 B: %ah, like you know dedicated %ah, line   

200.04 203.08 B: between your computer and theirs, %um  

204.28 208.57 B: now <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's, I think their price has gone down to about forty dollars a month   

209.82 210.23 B: so  

210.74 210.91 A: %hm  

210.90 214.19 B: I still need to do some more looking, these are all just kind of you know,  

215.48 216.68 B: %ah, hearsay  

217.07 217.77 A: uh-huh  

221.07 226.59 A: %mm %hm. and were you telling me once that you had an electronic news service  

227.27 228.18 A: through your computer?  

228.83 236.17 B: yeah, I used to r-, have %um &Zenec, which is %um, &Santa &Cruise &Operations version of &Unec [car horns in background]  

237.50 241.24 B: installed on my two eighty six, and %um   

243.03 249.12 B: it has you know <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's been %ah, reconfigured it back to a &Dos machine, we use it for   

249.83 256.07 B: %um, you know, burning ((EPROM's)) and you know doing kind of the low level   

257.19 259.79 B: %ah, development kinds of things on it   

261.94 263.62 A: what was the other thing you said [distortion, high volume on waves]  

264.11 265.20 B: EPROM programming?  

265.79 266.46 A: EPROM?  

267.28 268.99 B: yeah, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's --  

268.86 269.80 A: what, what is that?  

270.06 272.80 B: -- erasable, programmable, read only memory  

274.12 276.74 B: but <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's not modifiable unless you use a higher voltage   

279.53 284.74 B: hence the term, to burn a chip.  you you have the you have a programmer which   

285.90 291.19 B: has a special socket that you drop the chip into, and you then   

292.60 298.31 B: it then raises the voltage up to about, well depending on the chip, any, anywhere from twelve to twenty five volts  

299.56 301.85 B: normal operating voltage is at five volts   

302.67 305.65 B: so at the higher voltage, it %ah   

309.72 316.32 B: I forget the exact physics of it, but you end up %um, kind of like an &Etch a &Sketch you know, you you put some   

317.35 320.30 B: you you you burn zeros into it   

321.33 325.16 B: it starts out being all ones, and then you burn the zeros in  

323.94 325.31 A: {breath} mhm [distortion]  

325.56 326.59 B: and then you   

327.56 331.56 B: with a EPROM you use ultra violet light to %um,   

332.87 338.24 B: dislodge the electrons and then you know it, it erases it back to one   

338.75 339.07 A: oh  

339.27 342.73 B: and then <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's also electrically eraseable which uses another   

343.52 346.82 B: voltage to discharge the   

348.26 349.44 B: the memory location   

349.75 349.93 A: %hm [distortion]  

350.74 351.88 B: so <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's kind of a   

353.23 354.19 B: you know it takes about   

355.31 361.01 B: depending on the chip you know f- and the strength of the eraser anywhere from five to twenty minutes you erase it   

361.70 362.66 B: you know, and then <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['ve=>have]">you've got a   

363.27 368.92 B: you know download the program to the programmer and then it burns it in. so you know the whole thing   

370.10 372.66 B: can take you know a bit of time   

373.42 373.96 A: mhm  

373.89 375.85 B: but <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a you know <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a good way to %ah   

377.54 380.77 B: you know make changes to a system just by swapping out a chip   

381.61 381.96 A: mhm  

384.10 384.28 A: %hm  

386.04 386.84 B: and %um  

389.73 391.70 B: you know, so <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ve=>have]">we've got an EPROM programmer, <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ve=>have]">we've got a   

392.45 396.69 B: programmer, for you know, micro controllers, which also have EPROM in them   

397.63 398.39 A: mhm  

398.22 398.75 B: %um  

400.87 401.61 B: that kind of thing   

403.88 404.35 A: mhm  

406.47 411.51 B: oh, another thing we use it for is %ah like uploading and downloading programs from the H P forty eight G   

412.87 414.17 B: to a graphic calculator   

414.87 415.06 A: %hm  

414.89 415.51 B: programmable  

416.76 417.65 A: mhm  

417.91 422.62 B: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's good, we %ah, you know, <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's cheaper to buy a an H P
