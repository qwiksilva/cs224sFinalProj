0.00 3.77 A: Mike do you think the Soviet Union is still a threat to the United States
14.04 21.71 A: and <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's really not even a Soviet Union any more i mean <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's disintegrated ((it)) ((so)) sort of a silly question to be asking um
21.71 23.32 A: [noise] the uh
23.32 33.18 A: [vocalized-noise] a lot depends i guess on whether <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're afraid of weapons or if <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're afraid of intentions and [noise] and you know ideology [noise]
33.18 34.37 A: because
34.37 36.57 A: [noise] i guess a lot of the weapons that we- 
36.57 42.54 A: the U S and the Soviet Union both built up over decades are still around but [noise]
42.54 51.18 A: right right i mean [noise] <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['ve=>have]">there've been a- some agreements [noise] um i think <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's Start arms control con- treaty cut by thirty to fifty percent or something like that
51.18 55.49 A: [noise] but still you know thousands of weapons remain the question is whether or not [noise]
55.49 60.41 A: we worry about that as much anymore as we used to and i think <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're both agreeing that we <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't
64.83 66.15 A: um-hum
68.18 69.46 A: right
70.93 72.17 A: right
73.39 85.27 A: right [vocalized-noise] i mean <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's no doubt that because the weapons are there [noise] that [noise] we worry about the [noise] you know if they could be sold on black markets to countries like Libya or [noise] if um
85.27 96.51 A: you know if there was a another military attempted coup or something like that [noise] that seems like [noise] a separate question from whether or not the Soviet Union itself is still a threat to the U S because
96.51 99.08 A: no Soviet Union [laughter] i guess
99.08 101.61 A: [laughter] debating about semantics [noise]
101.61 103.40 A: [noise] um
103.40 109.99 A: what p- what could happen to make it less of a threat i guess was a ((dou-)) ((what)) ((air)) paraphrasing the next question 
129.01 130.41 A: um-hum
134.73 137.72 A: sort of ((think)) ((if)) they get integrated into
137.72 143.07 A: uh [vocalized-noise] ((like)) a western kind of community ((ess)) um
143.07 151.41 A: ((i)) mean after world war two we stopped worrying eventually about countries like Japan and Germany by [noise] making them more like ourselves [laughter]
151.41 152.88 A: [noise] uh
152.88 155.38 A: <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's right and uh [noise]
155.38 158.77 A: um i think Pepsi and Coke are fighting it out [laughter] [noise]
158.77 160.71 A: yeah get [noise]
162.70 165.29 A: right well <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's certainly true um [noise]
165.29 171.99 A: um and but having access also to [noise] on a more widespread scale instead of just the black market or [noise]
171.99 173.02 A: ((yeah))
177.00 178.37 A: um-hum
184.43 193.54 A: yeah well or go any- elsewhere like [noise] i think there have been thousands or hundreds of thousands of [noise] um jews immigrating to Israel in the last couple years now
193.54 198.12 A: which is something [noise] that we [vocalized-noise] pushed them for for twenty years [laughter]
198.12 199.40 A: [noise] um
201.09 203.16 A: [vocalized-noise] you were talking about uh
203.16 205.50 A: [noise] all these measures that sound sort of [noise]
205.50 212.74 A: [noise] domestic i guess [noise] if there were further efforts at disarmament or arms control i g- that would probably decrease the threat as well right
214.04 215.09 A: yeah
233.51 234.88 A: right [noise]
237.60 240.20 A: right and like we were saying [noise]
240.20 247.84 A: the mayb- the bigger fear may be [noise] those weapons falling into the hands of somebody we <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't want them to p- you know we [noise] we trusted [laughter] 
247.84 250.06 A: uh Brezhnev and uh
250.06 251.11 A: right
255.87 257.72 A: right right
257.72 258.99 A: [noise] but i ge- 
258.99 261.16 A: uh probably China [noise]
261.16 262.10 A: [noise] um
263.81 269.57 A: anyway that that i mean Patriot's obviously nonnuclear and you could argue that <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's defensive [noise]
269.57 270.63 A: [noise] but
279.47 287.12 A: ah right in yeah i see if you get the defense then you can learn how to overcome it with the offense [noise] well that that makes sense i guess [noise]
287.12 296.12 A: um but that <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's still a little different than worrying about if Soviet scientists suddenly start taking up residence in North Korea and Libya and [laughter]
296.12 298.46 A: [noise] places we still worry about
298.46 299.46 A: um
0.00 1.28 B: yeah
3.66 14.31 B: [noise] actually um no i don- i mean i think with all the uh the changes going ((on)) over there [noise] the um move towards democracy it seems like things are getting better
14.31 15.75 B: no- 
15.75 17.76 B: uh yeah
17.76 19.69 B: [noise] <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's right
40.93 44.45 B: yeah <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're being reduced sli- somewhat but
50.51 51.80 B: yeah
60.65 69.60 B: ((and)) i guess there is legitimate concern like um [noise] i mean <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just from a t v show last night but uh that you wonder <contraction e_form="[who=>who]['s=>is]">who's in charge over there because
69.60 74.69 B: we- the instability anybody could take over at any time it seems
82.69 84.19 B: right
89.15 90.40 B: right
98.00 99.43 B: [laughter]
101.00 102.49 B: [laughter] [noise]
107.33 108.79 B: uh
110.06 111.31 B: hm
112.45 114.36 B: perhaps
114.36 119.50 B: uh we- if the- [noise] if the economy gets better then they- then they can 
119.50 121.53 B: <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're more on their on- ((on)) ((enou-))
121.53 123.86 B: i guess <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's something separate maybe uh
123.86 127.94 B: i mean just basically i- if things get better over there and <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're [noise]
127.94 129.90 B: if the people
129.90 131.44 B: um [noise]
131.44 135.50 B: are happy with the government and <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't like try to overturn it ((or)) ((or)) ((over-)) [noise]
140.33 141.71 B: right
150.22 155.30 B: right [laughter] yeah now that we got McDonald's over there now so [laughter]
158.11 159.53 B: right
159.53 163.50 B: ((anywhere)) ((uh)) ((it)) <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're m- <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're moving in to more of a western culture
164.98 166.26 B: [vocalized-noise]
171.53 173.95 B: yeah and also maybe more of a [noise]
173.95 177.40 B: [noise] understanding and exchange between west and and and east [noise]
177.40 178.52 B: um
178.52 179.65 B: like
179.65 185.05 B: [noise] which seems to be happening i guess more freedom to- to travel over there and to- for them to come over here [noise]
185.05 186.51 B: [noise]
186.51 187.70 B: yeah
191.84 193.19 B: right
197.62 198.98 B: yeah
212.95 214.46 B: yeah definitely
214.46 216.22 B: um [noise] because like
216.22 218.70 B: [noise] kind of the way it works <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like uh
218.70 224.31 B: the- both sides having the weapons [noise] is a deterrent supposed to be an aterr- deterrent itself 
224.31 225.71 B: so that uh
225.71 228.44 B: the one side's got the same amount as the other i- it [noise]
228.44 234.17 B: [noise] <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's probably the ((l-)) ((the)) ((li-)) the likelihood of p- of one country using their weapons ((if)) another are probably pretty slim 
234.17 236.59 B: so there is a de- <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's kind of like uh
236.59 239.04 B: to balance out the powers
244.68 246.04 B: right
247.61 249.31 B: [noise] like uh
249.31 256.81 B: Saudi Arabia selling the Patriot missles or possibly or may- or maybe it was Israel <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm not sure who [noise] selling the Patriots over to to China i think it was
257.85 259.42 B: to China or Japan
260.77 261.89 B: yeah
267.31 268.52 B: right
269.92 273.31 B: but that could they could use that to learn how [noise]
273.31 274.53 B: to uh
274.53 279.81 B: oh well they the thing wa- the concern was that China supplies weapons to the Middle East
279.81 280.88 B: ((eh))
282.58 283.81 B: right
283.81 284.89 B: right
294.46 295.47 B: [laughter]
