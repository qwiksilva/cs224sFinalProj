237.32 248.60 A: [noise] uh and <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm sure as in any business things could improve but i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know overall whether [noise] uh <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm getting full value for that uh tax dollar [noise]
248.60 250.59 A: um i- i just d- i- 
250.59 258.91 A: [noise] i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have any f- way of of really determining that unless you get into the nitty gritty of a budget and see where every dollar goes [noise]

5.78 7.09 B: oh really
7.09 7.93 B: yeah
9.09 10.69 B: well [noise]
12.04 15.74 B: [noise] well i feel my real estate taxes are exhorbitant
15.74 20.42 B: and uh i think a lot of that is due to uh school taxes
20.42 26.50 B: uh from what i understand New Jersey has the uh highest education cost per pupil
26.50 33.00 B: uh over the entire United States i think even including Alaska where you might expect ((the)) cost to be higher
34.05 39.84 B: [noise] and <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm not exactly sure [noise] what that can be attributed to i think <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's a l- lot of it is uh
39.84 47.31 B: [noise] uh administrative costs because uh teachers <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't really get paid any more than um
47.31 50.45 B: [noise] other you know states in the northeast
50.45 54.31 B: but i think you get administrators i think <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ve=>have]">we've overloaded with administrators [noise]
54.31 59.59 B: [noise] so i think education costs are really one of the big expenses in New Jersey and and uh
61.69 62.84 B: [vocalized-noise]

71.36 72.77 B: oh really
73.92 75.02 B: yeah
78.89 85.15 B: yeah i- i think <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's true i think the uh they have stabilized the uh the school board costs
85.15 90.51 B: uh our municipal costs have have stabilized too but i think <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're just enormous to start out from [noise]
105.65 107.42 B: really yeah

143.48 153.33 B: right the quality of education i think is is reasonably good i just think <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're paying too much for it [noise] my wife happens to be a uh [noise] a learning disabilities consultant
153.33 160.94 B: [noise] and um i give her a a lot of grief because <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's one of these programs that are mandated by the state

175.47 188.84 B: <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're really getting our money's worth for for helping these students i think they have to be helped in some way but <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm [noise] <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm just wondering whether the process is really efficient and <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's just one of the kinds of uh [noise] services that <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're really paying for
201.60 202.72 B: um-hum
223.45 225.60 B: <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm sure it is [vocalized-noise]
