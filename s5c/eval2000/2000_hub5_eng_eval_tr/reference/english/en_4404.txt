573.41 574.00 A: oh no   

574.87 582.20 B: and we have had some problems with &Rochelle in the past and I always try to be really gentle in what I say to her about her weight    

582.55 583.31 A: uh-huh   

583.21 584.64 B: because <contraction e_form="[she=>she]['s=>has]">she's had some

607.11 607.49 A: %hm

633.02 636.37 B: than it seems necessary to me {breath}   

637.73 640.97 B: he rides her hard all the time about everything    

641.18 643.16 A: I I think this is normal    

643.49 645.47 B: yeah, and I thought the doctor was    

647.23 652.34 B: maybe a little more abrupt than he needed to be, it <contraction e_form="[was=>was][n't=>not]">wasn't our regular doctor    

655.00 655.61 B: {breath}    

655.82 656.46 A: {breath}    

656.37 662.46 B: so <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm working with her attitude on it, and <contraction e_form="[she=>she]['s=>has]">she's gone through some real depression    

663.27 665.80 B: about weight, because    

666.49 669.65 B: she tends to have friends who are built like &Jackie and &Jenny

674.20 677.69 B: she <contraction e_form="[wo=>will][n't=>not]">won't go to the mall, what teenage girls like to do is go to the mall with their friends    

678.69 684.05 B: because they want to go in to these teeny tiny shops the three five and seven or five   

682.13 684.70 A: and try things on   

684.90 688.52 B: yes, and then they want her to try things on, and things <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't fit    

688.95 689.30 A: yeah   

689.22 692.23 B: and she feels like <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>were]">they're deliberately humiliating her    

693.30 701.60 B: because she feels so humiliated and surely they must of known this would be humiliating well {breath} <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm sure they are completely clueless    

702.09 704.11 B: (( )) understand how terrible it feels ju- --

726.94 727.48 A: yeah   

727.59 731.71 B: when I see her with her friends, they <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't look like <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're all the same age    

733.77 738.21 B: and she just, needs some more, normal {laugh} sized friends    

739.41 744.66 A: I get to thinking, my very best friends were always short. 

747.72 753.55 A: and I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know if <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's because I was short myself, taller people intimidated me    

756.01 761.45 B: I <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know, well you know, my very best friend {laugh}

774.90 777.18 B: however, as an adult, I find myself    

779.34 785.97 B: in some ways feeling %um, a sort of bond when <contraction e_form="[I=>I]['m=>am]">I'm around short women    

786.19 786.71 A: mhm   

787.99 794.60 B: in oh yeah, this feels real comfortable here are other people who understand what <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's like when your feet <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't reach the floor {laugh}.
