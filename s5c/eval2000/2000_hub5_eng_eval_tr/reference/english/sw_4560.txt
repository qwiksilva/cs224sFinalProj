0.00 5.71 A: what was the last the uh remodeling or uh home project that <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['ve=>have]">you've worked on
15.72 17.12 A: oh
35.91 38.47 A: yeah that sounds like a good job
45.98 49.33 A: yeah it might even be enjoyable when the weather gets nice
55.96 57.56 A: well <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's good
66.09 67.49 A: um
73.88 76.06 A: is it an old house
77.25 78.54 A: oh
82.49 84.02 A: um-hum
84.02 85.61 A: i see
92.65 94.03 A: um
97.06 98.57 A: oh boy
99.73 114.15 A: [noise] well i have an old house and i just put a- i <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't do it myself i had a new furnace put in just a couple months ago [noise] and what- what they had here was an old gravity furnace that was converted into a forced-air gas furnace [noise] 
115.42 128.54 A: it- it just <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't keep the house warm at all and the fan hardly blew any air through the house [noise] so like you i have a- a- a stepped-up fan motor now and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just incredible the difference it makes with the new furnace
129.83 145.34 A: [noise] ah you mean in r p m i have no idea to tell you the truth <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's four or five settings in it [noise] actually we had to turn it down to one of the lower settings because uh [noise] the higher setting <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't keep uh <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't let the furnace get hot enough to work efficiently
145.34 147.52 A: [vocalized-noise] [vocalized-noise] uh the air <contraction e_form="[was=>was][n't=>not]">wasn't all that hot [noise]
147.52 152.55 A: [noise] <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's on one of the lower settings which is still quite a bit more than what we had before
159.31 160.74 A: right
162.80 164.21 A: yeah
168.62 170.03 A: sure
172.97 174.27 A: ((yeah)) ((oh))
175.53 178.54 A: right right you have to have it then
184.40 185.84 A: um-hum
192.65 195.24 A: [noise] uh [noise]
196.57 197.96 A: oh boy
199.11 201.86 A: wakes you up in the middle of the night that sort of thing huh
203.62 205.71 A: ((oh)) <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's good
210.46 213.04 A: ((uh)) [laughter]
213.04 215.22 A: [noise] not very peaceful
229.62 231.12 A: um-hum
233.19 236.71 A: ((no)) where you <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't need it [laughter]
241.46 242.69 A: um-hum
255.31 257.38 A: ((oh)) okay
258.80 264.71 A: oh <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's good well the last major thing we did ourselves was we decided to refinish our bedroom [noise]
264.71 272.73 A: [noise] w- to redo the bedroom the downstairs has all natural wood trim [noise] but the upstairs all the woodwork was painted we decided we <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't like that [noise] 
272.73 280.87 A: [noise] so we thought <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['d=>would]">we'd get ambitious and strip all the paint off of the woodwork and had i known what i was getting myself into i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't think i would have chosen to do that [noise]
280.87 287.06 A: [noise] but we started it so we finished it and we also had to tear all this old wallpaper off the walls [noise]
287.06 298.40 A: uh and that was quite a mess but [noise] it- <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's nice but <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>were]">we're a little disappointed because after getting all the wood off er uh um the paint off the wood upstairs we realized that it <contraction e_form="[was=>was][n't=>not]">wasn't the same quality wood [noise]
4.87 8.15 B: [noise] well <contraction e_form="[let=>let]['s=>us]">let's see um
8.15 13.19 B: [noise] the last thing i worked on [noise] <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['ll=>will]">we'll <contraction e_form="[let=>let]['s=>us]">let's see uh
13.19 16.51 B: [noise] i <contraction e_form="[have=>have][n't=>not]">haven't done an awful lot because i just bought my house here
16.51 28.88 B: um <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ve=>have]">i've been planning on doing some work [noise] uh to uh fix up some of the stuff around here and uh <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ve=>have]">i've been repairing some lights uh stuff like that
28.88 32.96 B: uh need to i need to seal the uh back deck [noise] 
32.96 37.05 B: [noise] since <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>was]">it's a a- a- w- <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['ve=>have]">they've allowed it to get a little bit weatherbeaten [noise] 
37.05 41.41 B: [noise] yeah well [noise] it- <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's uh
41.41 46.64 B: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>has]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['ll=>will]">it'll take a little while but [noise] once it gets a little bit warmer <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ll=>will]">i'll probably be going into it [noise]
48.40 51.26 B: um-hum [noise] yeah the uh
51.26 57.04 B: [noise] uh the house was kept in reasonably good re- repair by the people who [noise] who i bought it from
57.04 66.95 B: and uh but <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's a <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's a a number of things to do i also need to do [noise] some uh work with the uh uh heating and cooling system
66.95 74.38 B: [noise] it <contraction e_form="[does=>does][n't=>not]">doesn't uh get very good airflow to the upstairs uh b- they <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't design it very well so i have to put in some fans
75.52 84.76 B: [noise] no actually <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's pre- <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's fairly new uh <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's just that they <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't d- there there just i- <contraction e_form="[is=>is][n't=>not]">isn't any airflow to the upstairs because of bad ductwork design
84.76 88.98 B: uh also jus- and [noise] because of that they upped the uh fan rate [noise]
88.98 97.91 B: to something i- to very very high which makes it noisy downstairs and wears out the bearings so i just had to replace the bearings [noise] last weekend
97.91 100.45 B: uh because i had no heat [laughter]
106.25 107.75 B: um-hum
112.06 113.33 B: yeah [noise]
113.33 116.02 B: [noise] i had one of those at my previous house
127.71 130.25 B: yeah how fast is it running
131.55 132.71 B: um-hum
144.53 146.76 B: [noise] right right
146.76 148.29 B: right
150.98 152.14 B: yeah
152.14 159.67 B: [noise] yeah m- mine was turned up to uh [noise] fifteen hundred r p m uh normal is more like you know seven or eight hundred
159.67 169.22 B: uh so it gets a lot of airflow downstairs but uh still almost nothing upstairs [noise] <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's not that bad in the winter because the heat rises [noise]
169.22 176.53 B: um but in the summer f- wh- uh when <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's time for air conditioning [noise] it <contraction e_form="[wo=>will][n't=>not]">won't be very ((here)) [noise] very effective 
176.53 177.94 B: [noise] so i
177.94 179.76 B: yeah have to figure out [noise]
179.76 185.20 B: [noise] either some way to improve the ducting or s- uh to put a booster fan going to the upstairs 
185.20 188.87 B: um the bearings had um ((on)) ((this)) had worn out [noise]
188.87 190.18 B: [noise] to the point where
190.18 190.95 B: aw
190.95 197.41 B: [noise] it was rattling around [noise] rather rather badly and finally just threw it's belt off
197.41 199.26 B: so uh
200.98 206.83 B: yeah well <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's not that bad because i <contraction e_form="[can't=>cannot]">can't hear it upstairs but uh [laughter] the uh <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's
206.83 211.03 B: [noise] it gets to the point where you <contraction e_form="[can't=>cannot]">can't hear the the televison or talk [laughter]
211.03 214.35 B: of- or- or was getting to that point 
214.35 218.83 B: no [noise] it it doe- the the uh furnace does have enough uh
218.83 226.27 B: uh heating and cooling power [noise] to- to- so that the airflow <contraction e_form="[is=>is][n't=>not]">isn't a problem [noise] then whe- i had the inspector 
226.27 230.48 B: [noise] check that out and it was cooling th- cooling the air adequately
230.48 234.58 B: it was just [vocalized-noise] it was all the cooling was going downstairs
234.58 236.40 B: [laughter]
236.40 240.50 B: [noise] yeah oh well [noise] the um i just repaired a light
240.50 242.25 B: [noise] last weekend also
242.25 256.54 B: uh you know it ha- it has some hanging ((glassing)) panes around it [noise] with uh metal fringing and the metal fringing [noise] was like had uh bent away from the from the glass so ((they)) ((just)) glued it back together
256.54 259.60 B: so [noise] looks a lot better now [laughter]
264.26 265.54 B: um-hum
268.15 269.33 B: um-hum
270.69 272.36 B: oh yeah
