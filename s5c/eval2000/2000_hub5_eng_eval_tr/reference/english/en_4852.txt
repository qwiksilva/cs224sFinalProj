449.56 451.10 B: Can she walk better than she used to?  

450.43 456.22 A: yeah. I think she does. Her knee was the second time she had it done it was swollen a long long time more than the other one.  

455.05 455.49 B: Really?  

456.24 463.40 A: {breath} So it might have just been worse. But it just took a lot more recuperating and she had trouble with swelling and then she got an infection. {breath}

463.06 463.70 B: {lipsmack} oh.  

463.51 467.47 A: So it was a lot different from the first time. I think if it had happened this way she <contraction e_form="[would=>would][n't=>not]">wouldn't have had the second one done.  

467.83 470.50 B: Well we were talking to grandmother about having a shoulder replaced. {laugh}

587.23 587.64 B: Really?  

589.97 593.26 A: {breath} So they postponed it another week so then <contraction e_form="[you=>you]['re=>are]">you're like a month behind.
