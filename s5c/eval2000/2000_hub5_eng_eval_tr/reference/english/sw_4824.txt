81.16 84.56 A: [noise] which <contraction e_form="[is=>is][n't=>not]">isn't worth all that much and and buying a new one [noise]

89.80 95.59 A: and thought about buying a an eighty nine Corsica or something because we could about afford that based on what
95.59 98.89 A: [noise] without having to pay more that what we could sell our current car for
98.89 100.48 A: [noise] um
100.48 112.71 A: mainly <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're not real fussy people and anyway we want some s- basic features like uh air conditioning and and um [noise] and space you know headroom is is somewhat important 
112.71 114.81 A: [noise] and

116.66 120.72 A: [noise] <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're <contraction e_form="[we=>we]['re=>are]">we're looking primarily at price and potential reliability
120.72 124.43 A: and <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's one thing that was impressive about the Saturn is that [noise]
124.43 128.22 A: if there are problems <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['ve=>have]">they've s- <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['ve=>have]">they've been very good about fixing them

207.24 208.32 A: and
208.32 217.01 A: i sort of feel l- that while buying an American e- car whatever that means these days may not have much of an impact on the economy [noise] uh 
217.01 223.99 A: sending a signal t- t- to Saturn that that <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['re=>are]">there're people who who think that what <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're doing is the right thing 
223.99 233.05 A: [noise] might be useful on a on a somewhat smaller scale [noise] uh it <contraction e_form="[would=>would][n't=>not]">wouldn't overcome a couple of thousand dollars worth of difference in price for the same features though
238.13 239.96 A: Consumer Reports
239.96 249.65 A: [noise] yeah we saw that and and they were very highly uh thought of [noise] and what surprised me is that the car was peppier than

252.14 253.36 A: uh-huh
253.36 254.69 A: but

21.11 22.43 B: um-hum
23.82 32.25 B: uh th- the only thing i <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't like about the Saturn it was kind of like the uh Civic had stuff the Saturn <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't have like the airbag
32.25 38.28 B: and um just generally more features for for the money
38.28 45.07 B: uh i thought the Saturn was a good car except that it n- ((there)) ((was)) ((<contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's)) just not possible to get some of the uh features 
45.07 47.06 B: um but

49.85 56.96 B: [noise] right the airbag uh we- i guess you could al- you could also buy things like uh electric locks and things like that
56.96 64.95 B: yeah i guess you cou- if you wanted to pay for the extra ones then sure you know you could [laughter] always stick them on but the cost would have been greater
64.95 69.71 B: for the Saturn and th- the track record for the Saturn was unproven
