5.49 7.73 A: you <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have any children yet
12.54 27.52 A: well i have three children and <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ve=>have]">i've used various different kinds of daycare over the years uh i think actually the hardest time to find good daycare is when your <contraction e_form="[baby=>baby]['s=>is]">baby's very young
27.52 35.79 A: um because they <contraction e_form="[can't=>cannot]">can't tell you <contraction e_form="[what=>what]['s=>is]">what's going on the worst experience i had was when i was working
35.79 39.89 A: when my um oldest child was a baby
39.89 48.92 A: and i thought and i jus- i used the lady next door to me and you know it was close-by and it was convenient and he always came home clean and what have you [noise]
48.92 58.14 A: but i discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids once they started crawling and stuff was very different from what i wanted
58.14 64.27 A: for my son she always interfered and i understand that when you have uh um
64.27 70.55 A: [noise] you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're all taken care of and everything else you <contraction e_form="[can't=>cannot]">can't let
70.55 73.47 A: things escalate but
73.47 79.54 A: she would deprive the environment in order for the kids not to fight and then just stick them in front of the T V
79.54 86.86 A: and i i- you know and i <contraction e_form="[did=>did][n't=>not]">didn't discover that until later on and but it was summer i decided to quit working anyway but
86.86 98.62 A: i decided that actually the- the hardest time to find daycare is up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do it but once your baby starts crawling and stuff from then until they really start talking
98.62 102.21 A: <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's i- i find <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's the hardest time to find
102.21 106.12 A: really comfort- right now <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're seven five and three
106.12 107.53 A: yeah
107.53 112.93 A: so but then once <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['re=>are]">they're eighteen months old you can often find good preschool 
112.93 117.36 A: kinds of situations but i think <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's real important to check
117.36 124.54 A: how you want social interactions handled and how the school or daycare does it
124.54 131.86 A: you know the other things to check they always tell you you know check to make sure that <contraction e_form="[there=>there]['s=>is]">there's continuity of care that your child is gonna
131.86 136.02 A: have somebody that they can make an attachment to and stick with
136.02 139.69 A: 
139.69 148.28 A: well i used something sort of like a daycare center um for my youngest one when i went back to school last year
148.28 155.42 A: and it was something that was partially funded by the school and it was at a Y W C A
155.42 161.38 A: and that was pretty good the biggest problem i had there actually was that they
161.38 172.96 A: they try to provide continuity of care but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program you know <contraction e_form="[people=>people]['d=>would]">people'd drop out of school and so their kids would drop out of the program and ((they)) ((sent)) ((me)) ((on)) and so
172.96 177.99 A: and somebody would get sick and <contraction e_form="[they=>they]['d=>would]">they'd start shifting people around from one room to the next
177.99 180.25 A: and um
180.25 188.64 A: that was really tough on my son because <contraction e_form="[he=>he]['d=>had]">he'd made a real strong attachment with one particular caregiver and then that one
188.64 197.37 A: got switched out of his room but he he adjusted to it pretty well but that that was tough on him and they they
197.37 203.46 A: did their best not to do that <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>was]">it's just that you know they kept having uh
203.46 205.14 A: 
205.14 213.77 A: because they were using students to provide the care and because of the population of people who were using the care that became [noise]
213.77 218.35 A: um much more of an issue with them yeah
218.35 221.56 A: 
221.56 227.42 A: well in other words they should have the same person taking care of them
227.42 232.64 A: okay so that they the same faith the same and see different people even if
232.64 238.74 A: a daycare center or a home or a school or something has a philosophy
238.74 242.03 A: as to how to deal with certain kinds of situations
242.03 247.75 A: not every individual applies that philosophy in the same way
247.75 251.97 A: and so <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's nice for kids to have
251.97 254.38 A: a chance to get used to
254.38 256.10 A: how things are going to happen
256.10 263.41 A: so that they they- ne- an- they have a chan- they can start learning to predict a little bit i know real little ones <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't do very much predicting but [noise]
263.41 266.90 A: they should have a chance to say ah yes okay
266.90 271.57 A: <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm gonna get there and this is gonna happen and this is gonna happen and if i do this
271.57 277.03 A: an- <contraction e_form="[that=>that]['s=>is]">that's gonna happe- you kno- they should have a way to be able to predict <contraction e_form="[what=>what]['s=>is]">what's gonna happen to them [noise]
277.03 284.50 A: and uh if you keep changing the people who are there then they have no- nothing to hold on to
284.50 289.58 A: and <contraction e_form="[it=>it]['s=>is]">it's hard enough on little ones to be away from the parents
289.58 297.15 A: um and then different children too have different different ways of handling it one thing
297.15 298.63 A: i think that parents really d- 
0.00 6.45 B: okay um i personally <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't know a whole lot <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm o- <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['m=>am]">i'm twenty-one years old and i <contraction e_form="[do=>do][n't=>not]">don't have any children [laughter]
6.45 13.07 B: so but um <contraction e_form="[i=>i]['ve=>have]">i've baby-sat and stuff uh and i think about having children [laughter] so how about you
