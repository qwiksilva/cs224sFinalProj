 NIST Speech Disc: R63_1_1, Hub-5 2000 English Evaluation disc
---------------------------------------------------------------

This CDROM contains the English evaluation test material for 
NIST's Hub-5 2000 Conversational Telephone Speech Evaluation.

The data comes from unexposed English CALLHOME and unreleased 
Original-Switchboard-like Conversations.  These conversations 
were transcribed and time-marked by speaker turn, by the LDC.

Evaluation at a Glance
.......................

(1) Evaluation Begins:  March 1, 2000

Systems are to produce word-level transcripts and word-level
confidence scores for the complete set of evaluation test material.

The test material is stored in SPHERE format, consisting of forty,
two-channel, mu-law conversations. The data is located in the
directory:  
              ./hub5e_00/english/

The index file "./hub5e_00/english/hub5e_00.pem" identifies the
evaluation material. Each line in the PEM index file contains
information regarding one speech segment to be processed.

        PEM index file format:

        <waveform_id> <channel> <speaker> <beg_time> <end_time>
        ...

(2) Evaluation Ends:  March 31, 2000 at 7:00 PM EST (midnight GMT)

All system results should be submitted to NIST before the above
deadline.  A complete system description must be included with each
system run.


(3) Results Release:  April 14, 2000

NIST will release preliminary results to the participants.


(4) Follow-up Workshop:  May 16-19, 2000
