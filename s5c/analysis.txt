The optional-silence phone sil occupies 26.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 12.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 109.3 hours of data, or 80.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,22.3,65)
